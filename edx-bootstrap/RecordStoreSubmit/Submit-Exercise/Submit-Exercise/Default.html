                        Now were up in the big leagues getting' our turn at bat. Just two good ol' boys Never meanin' no harm. Beats all you've ever saw been in trouble with the law since the day they was born. Makin their way the only way they know how. That's just a little bit more than the law will allow? The Brady Bunch the Brady Bunch that's the way we all became the Brady Bunch. Come and play. Everything's A-OK. Friendly neighbors there that's where we meet. Can you tell me how to get how to get to Sesame Street. Here's the story of a man named Brady who was busy with three boys of his own. But they got diff'rent strokes. It takes diff'rent strokes - it takes diff'rent strokes to move the world! Their house is a museum where people come to see ‘em. They really are a scream the Addams Family. Love exciting and new. Come aboard were expecting you. Love life's sweetest reward Let it flow it floats back to you. Now were up in the big leagues getting' our turn at bat.
